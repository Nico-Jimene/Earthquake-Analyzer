# Earthquake-Analyzer



An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault plane. The location below the earthâ€™s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Scientists monitor and report earthquakes, assess earthquake impacts and hazards, and perform research into the causes and effects of earthquakes. US government agencies such as USGS (see Figure on
the right) or NOAA focus on recording and visualizing earthquakes data. For my CSC 113 Course at NC State I was given the task to sort, manipulate, and present the given data to give USA and World Report on 6000 earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present. Below are the functions defined:




getEQsFromFile.m - Load the data from the input file into MATLAB

getUSAEQs.m  - Determines what earthquakes are in the USA. This function needs to use the findStateOfEQ.m function

findLargestEQs.m -  Finds the top most powerful earthquakes. This function either prints to the Command Window (for analysis) or to an output file (for generating reports)

determineEQsPerYear.m - Determines the number of earthquakes that happened per year.

plotEQsPerYear.m - Plots the earthquakes for a specific year range

determineNumEQs.m - Determines the number of earthquakes either per continent (i.e. World) or per state (i.e.USA). 

plotNumEQs.m - Plots a bar graph for the number of earthquakes per continent

createEQMap.m - Creates a map visualization of the US, where each state is assigned a color based on how many earthquakes happened there.
